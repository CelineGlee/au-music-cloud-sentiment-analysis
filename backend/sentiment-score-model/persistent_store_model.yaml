# This Kubernetes PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) manifest defines storage that will be used
# to store the RoBERTa sentiment analysis model files. The PVC provides persistent storage
# that survives pod restarts and terminations, ensuring the downloaded model is retained
# for use by multiple pods.
#
# The PVC requests 4GB of storage with ReadWriteOnce access mode, meaning it can be
# mounted for read/write access by a single node at a time.
#
# The "perfretain" storage class indicates this uses performance-optimized storage
# that retains data even when no pods are using it.
